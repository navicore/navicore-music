# Responsive Design Implementation

## Overview
The Navicore Music app uses a responsive design that adapts intelligently to different screen sizes, providing an optimal experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Design Philosophy
- **Desktop First, Mobile Friendly**: The desktop experience is rich and uses available space effectively
- **No Wasted Space**: Every screen size gets a tailored layout
- **Touch Optimized**: Mobile interfaces have larger touch targets and simplified interactions
- **Performance**: Lightweight HTML + CSS with WASM only for complex components

## Breakpoints

### Mobile (< 768px)
- Single column layout
- Collapsible sidebar (hamburger menu)
- Fixed bottom player bar
- Simplified navigation
- 2-column grid for albums

### Tablet (768px - 1023px)
- Collapsible sidebar
- Main content takes full width
- 3-4 column grid for albums
- Compact player controls

### Desktop (1024px - 1919px)
- Fixed sidebar (250px)
- Main content area (flexible)
- Fixed now-playing panel (350px)
- Bottom audio player bar
- 5-6 column grid for albums

### Ultra-wide (1920px+)
- Same layout as desktop but with:
- Larger spacing
- 8+ column grid for albums
- Max content width for readability

## Key Features

### Adaptive Grid System
```html
<!-- Responsive grid that scales with screen size -->
<div class="grid grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-3 md:grid-cols-4 lg:grid-cols-5 xl:grid-cols-6 2xl:grid-cols-8 gap-4">
```

### Mobile-Specific Player
- Compact design at bottom of screen
- Essential controls only
- Swipe gestures for next/previous
- Tap to expand full player

### Desktop Now-Playing Panel
- Always visible on right side
- Shows album art, track info, and queue
- Quick access to related content
- Drag-and-drop queue management

### Responsive Tables
- Full table on desktop
- Hidden columns on smaller screens
- Touch-friendly row heights on mobile

## Technical Implementation

### CSS Strategy
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first responsive design
- DaisyUI for consistent component styling
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
- Container queries for component-level responsiveness

### Progressive Enhancement
1. Base HTML works without JavaScript
2. HTMX adds interactivity
3. WASM components enhance experience
4. Service worker for offline support (future)

### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading images
- Virtual scrolling for large lists
- Responsive images with srcset
- CSS containment for layout stability
