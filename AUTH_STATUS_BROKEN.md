# AUTHENTICATION IS COMPLETELY BROKEN

## Current State: NON-FUNCTIONAL
**Date**: December 2024
**Status**: Project shelved due to authentication failures

## What We Tried and Failed

### Attempt 1: Cross-Domain Cookies
- **Approach**: HttpOnly cookies across api.navicore.tech and music.navicore.tech
- **Result**: Race conditions, cookies not propagating between domains
- **Issues**: 
  - Login required 4-5 attempts to work
  - Cookie set but not immediately available
  - Logout completely broken

### Attempt 2: localStorage + Bearer Tokens
- **Approach**: Store JWT in localStorage, send as Bearer token
- **Result**: Same race conditions as cookies
- **Issues**:
  - localStorage write/read timing issues
  - Page reload before storage completes
  - Still required multiple login attempts

### Attempt 3: Pure HTMX Server-Side Sessions
- **Approach**: Server-rendered auth UI, cookies for session
- **Result**: Partially implemented, still broken
- **Issues**:
  - Login hangs with "Login successful! Redirecting..." 
  - Auth state cached in HTML, persists after cookie deletion
  - Logout non-functional
  - Mixed paradigms (JavaScript auth checks + HTMX forms)

## Core Problems Never Solved

1. **Race Conditions**: Every approach had timing issues between setting auth state and checking it
2. **Domain Boundaries**: api.navicore.tech vs music.navicore.tech cookie/CORS issues
3. **State Synchronization**: Client and server auth state constantly out of sync
4. **HTMX Integration**: Never achieved pure HTMX auth flow without JavaScript pollution
5. **HTML Caching**: Auth state getting cached in rendered HTML

## Symptoms of the Broken System

- Login shows success but user not actually logged in
- Takes 4-5 login attempts before it "sticks"
- Logout button doesn't work at all
- Clearing cookies/storage doesn't log out user (state cached in HTML)
- "Remember me for 30 days" checkbox was invisible/broken
- False success messages on failed logins

## Architecture Confusion

We kept mixing paradigms:
- HTMX for some parts (login form)
- JavaScript for others (auth status checks)
- Client-side state (localStorage/cookies) 
- Server-side rendering
- JSON APIs mixed with HTML responses

## Next Steps When Resuming

1. **Pick ONE approach and stick to it**:
   - Either pure HTMX (no JavaScript auth)
   - Or pure SPA (no HTMX for auth)
   - Not both

2. **Solve the domain problem**:
   - Consider moving everything to one domain
   - Or use proper session management service
   - Or implement OAuth/OIDC properly

3. **Test infrastructure first**:
   - Verify cookies work across domains
   - Verify HTMX redirects work
   - Verify no HTML caching issues

4. **Consider alternatives**:
   - Cloudflare Access for auth
   - Third-party auth service (Auth0, Clerk, etc.)
   - Server-side sessions in D1 instead of JWT cookies

## DO NOT REPEAT

- Don't mix HTMX and JavaScript auth
- Don't assume cookies "just work" across subdomains
- Don't rely on client-side state for auth
- Don't patch symptoms without fixing root causes
- Don't implement "temporary" workarounds

## Files to Review

- `/build/worker/auth.mjs` - Mixed JWT + cookie mess
- `/dist/index.html` - JavaScript auth checks that shouldn't exist
- `/dist/templates/login.html` - HTMX form that doesn't work properly
- `/build/worker/auth-panel.mjs` - Attempted server-side panel (untested)
- `SESSION_ARCHITECTURE.md` - "One True Way" that we never got working

## Final Note

The authentication system is fundamentally broken at an architectural level. 
It needs to be completely redesigned, not patched.
Every "fix" made it worse by adding more complexity without solving core issues.
